  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>You may know Guitar pro, tux guitar, Rocksmith 2014, Yousician, Rocksmith+?. Well those are cool and probably match
    your expectations better than RAF. I just want to have something simple (well I try), play a song, display the
    tablature progressively and choose the speed of the song.</p>

  <h2>How to</h2>
  <p>You can browse your files to select a guitarpro file with the song you want to learn.<br />
    Then select the instrument to display (Track selector).<br />
    Then click play.
  </p>
  <p>You can download tabs on <a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/explore?type[]=Pro" target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ultimate guitar</a> for example (you'll need an account). Then search for the
    song you want then filter
    by «Guitar Pro». Download the file (at the bottom of page).</p>

  <h2>Current state</h2>
  <p>As you see, it does not work very well yet. It is in very early stage. If you want to be involved, send a mail to
    <a href="mailto:raf@bruit-contraire.net">raf [at] bruit-contraire (dot) net</a>, star the github repo or send me
    greetings <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@dey">on mastodon</a>
